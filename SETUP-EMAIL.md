# Switching on sign-in and email (Gmail and Outlook)

The site works fully without this. Do it once to switch on:

- **Email** – send the sell sheet from your own Gmail or Outlook address (with Cc/Bcc and attachments).
- **Customer sync** – your saved customers follow you to any device when you sign in.

Nothing is stored on a server of ours. Email is sent from your own account, and customers are saved in a hidden
app folder in **your own** Google Drive or OneDrive that only this site can read.

You need two free "Client IDs": one from Google, one from Microsoft. Each takes about 10 minutes.
You can do just one of them; the other button stays switched off.

Your site addresses (add every one you use):

- GitHub Pages: `https://lumiflooshed-alt.github.io/sellsheet/`
- Cloudflare Pages, if you set it up: `https://YOUR-NAME.pages.dev/`

## 1. Google (Gmail and Google Workspace)

1. Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com> and sign in.
2. At the top, click the project picker, then **New project**. Name it `Sell Sheet Studio` and click **Create**. Make sure it's selected.
3. Open **APIs & Services → Library**. Search for and **Enable** both:
   - **Gmail API**
   - **Google Drive API**
4. Open **Google Auth Platform** (or **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**) and click **Get started**:
   - App name: `Sell Sheet Studio`. User support email: your email.
   - **Audience**:
     - Choose **Internal** if everyone using it is in your own Google Workspace organisation. No review is needed.
     - Otherwise choose **External**.
   - Contact email: your email. Accept the policy and click **Create**.
5. If you chose **External**, go to **Audience → Test users → Add users** and add every Google address that will sign in (up to 100).
   - They'll see a "Google hasn't verified this app" screen the first time. Click **Continue**.
   - To remove that screen for everyone you'd have to submit the app for Google's verification. That's only needed if you open it to the public.
6. Go to **Clients → Create client**:
   - Application type: **Web application**. Name: `Sell Sheet Studio`.
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: click **Add URI** and enter `https://lumiflooshed-alt.github.io`. Add your Cloudflare address too if you have one, e.g. `https://YOUR-NAME.pages.dev`.
   - Enter origins only, with no `/sellsheet/` at the end. Leave **Authorized redirect URIs** empty.
   - Click **Create**.
7. Copy the **Client ID**. It looks like `1234567890-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com`.

## 2. Microsoft (Outlook.com, Hotmail and Microsoft 365)

1. Go to <https://entra.microsoft.com> (or <https://portal.azure.com>) and sign in with your Microsoft account.
2. Open **App registrations** (under **Applications**) and click **New registration**:
   - Name: `Sell Sheet Studio`.
   - Supported account types: **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
   - Redirect URI: choose **Single-page application (SPA)** and enter `https://lumiflooshed-alt.github.io/sellsheet/` (with the slash at the end).
   - Click **Register**.
3. If you use Cloudflare too, open **Authentication**, and under **Single-page application** click **Add URI** and add `https://YOUR-NAME.pages.dev/`. Save.
4. Open **API permissions → Add a permission → Microsoft Graph → Delegated permissions**. Tick these and click **Add permissions**:
   - `Mail.Send`
   - `Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder`
   - `User.Read`, `offline_access`, `openid` and `profile` (User.Read is usually already there)
5. On **Overview**, copy the **Application (client) ID**. It looks like `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555`.

Work or school Microsoft 365 accounts: some organisations require an admin to approve new apps. If you see "Need admin approval", ask your IT admin. They can click **Grant admin consent** on the API permissions page.

## 3. Put the IDs into the site

Either send the two IDs to Claude, or do it yourself:

1. On GitHub, open `index.html` in this repository and click the pencil (**Edit**) icon.
2. Search for this line:

   ```js
   const EMAIL_SETUP={google:'',microsoft:''};
   ```

3. Paste your IDs between the quotes:

   ```js
   const EMAIL_SETUP={google:'1234567890-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com',microsoft:'11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555'};
   ```

4. Click **Commit changes**. The site updates within a minute or two.

Client IDs are not passwords. They're meant to be public and only work from the site addresses you listed above.

## Good to know

- **Signing in is optional.** Without it, customers are saved in that browser, and **Share instead…** in the Email window still hands the files to your device's own email app.
- **Sign-ins last about an hour**, and only in that browser tab. After that the site asks you to sign in again. Your customers are kept either way.
- **Sending limits:**
  - Gmail: about 500 emails a day, or 2,000 on Google Workspace.
  - Outlook: about 30 a minute. The site paces large sends automatically.
  - Outlook emails must be under about 4 MB in total. If you hit that, untick an attachment.
- **To remove access at any time:**
  - Google: <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions>
  - Microsoft: <https://account.live.com/consent/Manage> (personal) or <https://myapps.microsoft.com> (work)
